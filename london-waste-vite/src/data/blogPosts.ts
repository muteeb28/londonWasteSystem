      <h2>Planning Your House Clearance</h2>
      <p>House clearance can be an overwhelming task, especially when dealing with decades of accumulated belongings. Whether you're clearing a family home after bereavement, downsizing, or preparing for a move, proper planning is essential for a smooth process.</p>
      
      <h3>Before You Start</h3>
      <p>Before beginning your house clearance, take time to identify valuable items, important documents, and sentimental belongings. Create three categories: keep, donate, and dispose. This initial sorting will save time and ensure nothing important is accidentally discarded.</p>
      
      <h3>What to Expect from Professional Services</h3>
      <p>Professional house clearance services like London Waste Management handle everything from initial assessment to final cleanup. We sort through items responsibly, ensuring recyclable materials are processed correctly and valuable items are identified for donation or sale.</p>
      
      <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Modern house clearance prioritizes environmental responsibility. We ensure that 95% of cleared items are recycled or reused, keeping waste out of landfills and supporting sustainable practices.</p>
      
      <h3>Costs and Timeline</h3>

      <h3>What Needs to Go</h3>
      <p>Dead plants, fallen branches, old compost, broken garden furniture, and overgrown shrubs should be cleared to make way for spring planting. Proper removal ensures healthy soil and prevents pest problems.</p>

      <p>Garden waste can be composted, chipped for mulch, or processed into biomass fuel. Professional garden clearance services ensure organic materials are handled sustainably.</p>
      
      <h3>Planning Your New Garden</h3>
      <p>Clearance provides an opportunity to reassess your garden layout. Consider drainage, sunlight patterns, and accessibility when planning improvements.</p>
      
      <h3>Professional vs DIY</h3>

    content: `
      <h2>The Psychology of Clutter</h2>
      <p>Clutter affects mental well-being, productivity, and quality of life. Understanding why we accumulate items helps develop better habits and makes decluttering more effective and lasting.</p>
      
      <h3>Getting Started: The Preparation Phase</h3>
      <p>Before beginning, gather supplies: boxes for sorting, cleaning materials, and bags for donations. Set realistic goals and timeline to avoid overwhelming yourself.</p>
      
      <h3>Room-by-Room Strategy</h3>
      <p>Start with less emotional spaces like bathrooms or hallways. Living rooms and bedrooms come next, with sentimental areas like attics or family rooms saved for when you've built momentum and confidence.</p>
      
      <h3>The Four-Box Method</h3>
      <p>Use four categories for every item: Keep, Donate, Sell, and Dispose. This method speeds decision-making and ensures nothing gets overlooked or placed in the wrong pile.</p>
      
      <h3>Maintaining Your Progress</h3>
      <p>Decluttering isn't a one-time event. Implement daily habits, seasonal reviews, and mindful purchasing to maintain your newly organized space long-term.</p>
